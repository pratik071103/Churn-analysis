# Churn-analysis

ðŸ“„ Project Description
In this project, I led an end-to-end Churn Analysis initiative using an open-source customer dataset to uncover valuable business insights and improve customer retention strategies. The project workflow included:

Data Exploration and Preparation (SQL):

Utilized SQL extensively for data exploration, identifying key patterns and potential issues in the dataset.

Handled missing values (null handling) and performed necessary data transformations to ensure the data was clean, consistent, and well-structured for further analysis.

Prepared the final cleaned dataset, ready for integration into Power BI.

Dashboard Development (Power BI):

Designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard focused on key business metrics, including:

Total Customers

New Joiners

Churn Rate

Total Churned Customers

Implemented age-based bucketing to group customers into meaningful segments, enabling intuitive filtering and more dynamic visual storytelling.

Advanced Functionality and Insights:

Enhanced the dashboard's analytical capabilities by unpivoting multiple service columns, allowing the creation of a detailed matrix view that provides a more granular perspective on customer service usage.

Implemented dynamic tooltips that reveal personalized churn reasons when users hover over customer records, offering deeper behavioral insights and helping to identify churn patterns more effectively.

Outcome:
The final dashboard not only visualizes churn trends but also empowers users to drill down into the data, filter across different age groups, services, and churn reasons, thus enabling data-driven decision-making for customer retention strategies.
